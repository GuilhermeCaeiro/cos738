# Execution

### In order to run this code, everything can be run at once by running:
python run_all.py
### Alternatively, each module can be executed individually. To achive that, you must first import the proper class, like in the following example:
from src.inverted_list_generator import InvertedListGenerator
### And then instantiate it and call its "run()" method:
InvertedListGenerator().run()
### Examples of that can be found in the file run_all.py.

# Dependencies

### A part from libraries included into Python's default library, this code also relies on "numpy", "nltk" and "unidecode" for a series of task. In order to install those libraries you can run:
pip install numpy nltk unidecode
